# McCarthy

Now in the above function M() we implemented the mathematical form of the McCarthy 91 function by using recursion because recursion is its easiest approach, we used the number taken as an argument and asked if number is greater than 100 then return number-10 else return the recursive statement as defined in the definition, and it returns the value  according to McCarthy 91 function.
